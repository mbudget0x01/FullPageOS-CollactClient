# FullPageOS Collact-Client FORK

This is a fork of the [FullPageOS](https://github.com/guysoft/FullPageOS). The aim of this fork is to create a ready to use Image to use as a Client for the Collact software. After installing the OS no further Configuration should be necessary and it should work for multiple clients in the same network.
